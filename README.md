# Description
The main idea behind Feuerwehr is to build a simple, fun to play VR game. Contrary to the competitors (there are very few), there is no need to focus on realism, which brings many other problems. With some genre exceptions, VR is not a platform for hardcore competitive games, and that’s why we’re pursuing to make the game relaxing and comfortable.
